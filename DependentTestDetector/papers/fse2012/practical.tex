In principle, there is no \emph{ground truth} for the order of test
execution.
Therefore, we assert that the
\emph{programmer-defined} execution order, and consequently the test
results from executing the test suite in that order, are the ground
truth for our experiments.
%would naturally serves 
%the ``truth'' for our definitions of test dependence, and records
%the results from that execution order as intended results (line 2, Figure~\ref{fig:dtalgorithm}).

When a dependent test is identified, programmers may wish to know
a minimal list of other tests on which the identified test depends. 
Given an execution sequence that manifests the dependence, Delta
Debugging (also implemented in our tool) can
be used to return a shortest subsequence 
that still manifests the dependence~\cite{Zeller:2002}. 
%to minimize the recorded
%test list before the dependent test was executed.
%\todo{SZ}{is it clear? or need more explanation?}


In practice, another possible way to help detect potential dependent tests is
to leverage programmers' domain knowledge or employ some program analyses
to identify a subset of tests that are likely to contain dependent tests,
and run the algorithm only on that subset instead of the whole suite.

\todo{sz}{need a summary sentence here for the whole section 5.}

%\todo{DN}{I'm on the side of removing DD if reasonable, and coming back
%to the idea later, maybe in a ``practical considerations'' section/subsection}
%In addition, the algorithm employs Delta debugging~\cite{Zeller:2002}
%to minimize the test set that are executed before a test in
%an execution (lines 7--8). Together with the minimized
%dependent test set, the test revealing with different behaviors
%are added to the output (line 9).


%\todo{JW}{We should mention that we used the tool to find/verify the
%examples. We should also mention that isolation corresponds to $k=1$
%and we did pair-wise (corresponding to $k=2$).}
%\todo{JW}{
%For reverser execution, as far as I remember, we didn't use it to for
%the actual examples we have. But we might claim that it is useful for
%identifying particular kinds of deps. But it would be better if we had
%an example for that.}
