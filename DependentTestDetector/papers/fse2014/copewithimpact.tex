\section{Coping With the Impact}
\label{sec:cope}

Test dependence can cause non-trivial repercussions
to both developers and downstream testing techniques.
When test dependence arises, developers should quickly
identify its root causes and downstream testing techniques
should respect the potential dependence and keep the
test execution results consistent.

This section presents a family of techniques to cope with the
impact of test dependence. First, we present an automated
technique to identify the root cause of test dependence
(Section~\ref{sec:coperoot}). Second, to alleviate the
impact on downstream testing techniques, we present a family
of techniques to enhance existing test prioritization,
test selection, and test parallelization techniques (Section~\ref{sec:copeenhance}).

All proposed techniques are empirically evaluated on
our subject programs (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}).

\subsection{Automatically Explaining Test Dependence}

Explaining the root cause of test dependence requires

The global variables involved are usually buried deep in
the program code, and the assertions do not directly check
them, but rather check values that have been computed from
them. In any non-trivial real-world program, this deep nesting e?ectively hides potential dependencies from developers,
and they may only become aware of them when a subtle bug
leads them there.
