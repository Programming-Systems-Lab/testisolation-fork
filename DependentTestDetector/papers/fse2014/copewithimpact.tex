\section{Coping With the Impact}
\label{sec:cope}

Test dependence can cause non-trivial repercussions
to both developers and downstream testing techniques.
When test dependence arises, test prioritization,
selection, and parallelization techniques
should respect the potential dependence and keep the
test execution results consistent.

This section presents a family of techniques to alleviate the
impact of test dependence on test prioritization, test
selection, and test parallelization techniques. All algorithms
take a test suite and known test dependence as input, and
generate test prioritization, selection, and parallelization orders
that reveal the same results as in the original
test suite, correspondingly.


The three algorithms utilizes the function processDependentTests
to reorder its dependent tests as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:processDT}.
The processDependentTests function creates a new empty set (line 1)
then goes through each test in $\mathit{T}$ and tries to add each
test to the new set (line 2-4), taking into account its dependences
when adding a test. 


In order to add a test to the new set, processDependentTests calls
addDependentTest. addDependentTest first checks whether the test
being added is already contained in the new set, if it is then the
test will be ignored (line 1). Otherwise the function retrieves all
tests that when executed after this test will cause this test to be
dependent (line 2) and adds all of those tests to the new set first
by recursively calling this method with them (line 3-5). Once all
the tests that needs to come before this test has been added to
the new set, the test itself is added to the set (line 6). The
function concludes by recursively adding all tests that when executed
before this test will cause it to be dependent to the new set (line 7-9).     


%First, we present an automated
%technique to identify the root cause of test dependence
%(Section~\ref{sec:coperoot}). 
%Second, to alleviate the
%impact on downstream testing techniques, we present a family
%of techniques to enhance existing test prioritization,
%test selection, and test parallelization techniques (Section~\ref{sec:copeenhance}).
