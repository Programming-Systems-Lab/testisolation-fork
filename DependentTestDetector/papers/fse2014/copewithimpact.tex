\section{Coping With the Impact}
\label{sec:cope}

Test dependence can cause non-trivial repercussions
to both developers and downstream testing techniques.
When test dependence arises, developers should quickly
identify its root causes and downstream testing techniques
should respect the potential dependence and keep the
test execution results consistent.

This section presents a family of techniques to cope with the
impact of test dependence. First, we present an automated
technique to identify the root cause of test dependence
(Section~\ref{sec:coperoot}). Second, to alleviate the
impact on downstream testing techniques, we present a family
of techniques to enhance existing test prioritization,
test selection, and test parallelization techniques (Section~\ref{sec:copeenhance}).

All proposed techniques are empirically evaluated on
our subject programs (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}).

\subsubsection{Threats to Validity}

There are several threats to the validity
of our experiments. First, \dtexplain 
only considers test dependencies arised
from improper field access. It may not
produce useful results for other types of
test dependencies~\cite{}. Second,
\todo{evaluating on the test coverage, no
bug finding abilities yet.}

\subsubsection{Experimental Conclusions}

We have two chief findings. \textbf{(1)} \dtexplain
generates concise report to explain why
test dependence arises, and such report
helps developers to understand the root cause
of test dependence. \textbf{(2)} All
enhanced downstream testing techniques
output consistent results on test suites
containing dependent tests.
