\label{sec:algorithm-tool}

In this section we present an algorithm and a prototype tool to detect dependent
tests.
In the worst case, a naive, exhaustive search would execute all $n!$
permutations of the test suite to detect dependent tests. While this
is not feasible for realistic $n$, our approximate algorithm uses 
our intuition that many dependences can be found by running only short subsequences of
test suites, and introduces a bound $k$ on the length
of subsequences. That effectively bounds the execution time to
$O(n^k)$, which for small $k$ is tractable. At the same time, our
prototype tool and the experiments we conducted with it, suggest that
many dependences can be found for small $k$.
