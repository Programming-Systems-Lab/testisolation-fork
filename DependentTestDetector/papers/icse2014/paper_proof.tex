\noindent \textbf{Theorem} All tests in a test permutation discarded by the getPossibleExecOrder
function in the dependence-aware $k$-bounded algorithm are guaranteed to produce the same results as in its default order.\\



\noindent \textbf{Proof.} We prove this theorem by contradiction. Given a test
suite $T$ and a test permutation $P$ of $T$, let's assume
permutation $P$ is discarded by the getPossibleExecOrder function
since all fields read by each test in $P$ are written
by the same test as in $T$. The initial values of all shared fields are the same across different executions.


Suppose there exists a test $t \in P$ produces a different result
than in $T$. Test $t$ must read a different value
for at least one shared field. Without loss of generality,
let's suppose $f$ is the shared field read by $t$ with
a different value. Based on our assumption, 
$f$ is written by the same test, denoted as $t'$, as in $T$.
Since the $f$'s value is different in $P$, $t'$
must read different values for other shared fields.
By induction, there must exist a test $t'' \in P$ that 
reads a different \textit{initial} value
for at least one shared field. This contradicts
the assumption that tests are executed in the same environment with the initial values of all shared fields.
