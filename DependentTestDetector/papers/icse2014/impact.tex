\subsubsection{The Impact on Test Prioritization}
\label{sec:impact}

We manually investigated the
impact of dependent tests on two well-known
downstream testing techniques: test
selection and test prioritization.
We counted the number of dependent tests in the
4 human-written test suites that can
theoretically affect the results of these two techniques.
For test selection, we manually checked whether
there exists a subsequence of tests
that do not return the same results
when executed in the \textit{same} order
as in the original test suite. 
For test prioritization, we manually check whether
there exists a possibly-\textit{reordered}
subsequence of tests that do not return the
same results as in the original test suite.
As a result, 26 out of 29 dependent tests can
%besides the synoptic test, and 2 jodatime tests
affect the results of test selection,
and all 29 dependent tests can affect the results
of test prioritization.
