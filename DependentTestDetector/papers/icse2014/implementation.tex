\section{Tool Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}


We implemented our dependent test detection algorithms in
a prototype tool. Our tool is fully-automated, and the
current implementation supports JUnit 3.x/4.x tests.
For the basic, $k$-bounded dependent test detection algorithm
(Section~\ref{sec:basic}), our tool takes a test suite
and the bounding parameter $k$ as inputs, 
exhaustively executes every $k$-tuple
of tests, and compares execution results to identify possible dependence cases. When
comparing the observed result of a test in an execution order with
its intended result,
We consider JUnit test results to be the same when the tests either
both pass, or exactly the same exception or assertion violation leads
to test failure.
The tool creates a fresh JVM for each \testlist, thus, ignoring
external state such as files and OS services, the environment
that the test suites are executed in is always the same $\env_0$.
This ensures that there is no interaction between
different \testlist\ through shared memory.

For the improved algorithm (Section~\ref{sec:advalgorithm}),
our tool uses ASM \todo{describe the Darioush's implementation details
here.}


Our prototype tool also implements the Delta debugging algorithm~\cite{Zeller:2002}
to return the shortest sequence of tests that manifest a dependency
for a given test $t_i$.

%However, due to the computational complexity of the general dependent test
%detection problem, it is difficult to know precisely how many dependent
%tests exist in a test suite. Thus, we do not
%yet have empirical data that shows how many percentages of dependence tests
%our tool can catch. Giving a reasonable estimation
%is one of our future work.

%we do not yet have strong empirical data that shows our algorithm catches X
%percentage or Y of the worst test dependences. It is one of our future work.
