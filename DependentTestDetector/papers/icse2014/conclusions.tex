\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:questions}

Test independence is broadly assumed but rarely addressed, and
test dependence has largely been ignored in previous
research on software testing. To understand
dependent tests, we provide a
precise formalization of the test dependence problem,
and describe one of the studies on real-world dependent
tests from popular software issue tracking systems. Guided by
this study, to detect dependent tests, we design
and implement \todo{two?} algorithms to identify manifest test dependence
in a test suite. Our empirical evaluation on \todo{num?}
real-world subject programs suggests that \todo{conclusions.}
