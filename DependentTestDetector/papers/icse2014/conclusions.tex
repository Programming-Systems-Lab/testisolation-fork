\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:questions}

Test independence is broadly assumed but rarely addressed, and
test dependence has largely been ignored in previous
research on software testing. To understand
dependent tests, we provide a
precise formalization of the test dependence problem,
and describe one of the first studies on real-world dependent
tests from popular software issue tracking systems. Guided by
this study, to detect dependent tests, we design
and implement three algorithms to identify manifest test dependence
in a test suite. Our empirical evaluation reveals
previously-unknown dependent tests in every subject program
we studied, from both human-written and automatically-generated test
suites.
