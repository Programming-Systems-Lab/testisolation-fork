\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:questions}

Test independence is broadly assumed but rarely addressed, and
test dependence has largely been ignored in previous
research on software testing. To understand
dependent tests, we describe one of the first studies on
real-world dependent tests, and
provide a precise formalization of the dependent test detection
problem. To detect dependent tests, we design
and implement three algorithms to identify manifest test dependence
in a test suite. Our empirical evaluation reveals
previously-unknown dependent tests in every subject program
we studied, from both human-written and automatically-generated test
suites.

The results of this paper offer initial answers to four questions we posed
in the introduction. First, test dependence \textit{does}
arise in practice, from both human-written test suites and automatically-generated
test suites. Second, dependent tests can have
non-trivial negative repercussions, even though the
extent is unknown. Third, we speculate that this
problem is not thoroughly examined before due to the
lack of empirical evidence, a rigirous problem formulation,
and detection algorithms.
Fourth,
detecting manifest dependent tests is a NP-complete problem,
for which efficient algorithms are unlikely to exist. However,
in practice, a simple algorithm like the randomized algorithm
described in this paper can work fairly well.
