\caption{{\label{tab:studyresults}
Real-world dependent tests.
Column ``Total Number'' shows the total number of identified dependent tests.
Column ``Severity'' is the developers' assessment of the importance of the
test dependence.
Column ``\#Involved Tests for Manifestation'' is the number of tests needed
to manifest the dependence. Column ``Days'' is the
average days taken by developers to resolve a dependent test.
Column ``Patch Location'' shows how developers fixed the dependent tests:
by modifying program code, by modifying test code, or not fixed.
In column ``Dependence Root Cause'', ``other'' execution environment
differences include language, locale, and databases.\todo{``other'' is over
  twice as large as ``File system''.  Therefore, I suggest that it be
  broken down to show at least every column that is at least 3 root
  causes.  Then, expand the list of ``other'' here in this caption (or, better, move
  that expansion to the body of the paper, which will keep this caption
  from being too large), which
  will emphasize that nothing else is as important as the ones that are
  listed explicitly in the table.  Also, what is ``N/A'' in the table?  Are
those unknown, or something else?  It needs a better name and also an explanation.}
