%Dependent tests in Crystal fall into the following three groups, which
%share the same root cause of global data dependence across multiple tests:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item 9 dependent tests come from the \CodeIn{DataSourceTest} class.
%In that class, a test method \CodeIn{testSetField} initializes a global variable \CodeIn{data}
%and other test methods read the value of the \CodeIn{data} variable.
%As a result, when a test using \CodeIn{data} is executed in isolation or executed
%before the \CodeIn{testSetField} method, a \CodeIn{NullPointerException} is
%thrown.
%
%\item 7 dependent tests come from class \CodeIn{LocalStateResultTest}.
%In that class, a test method \CodeIn{testLocalStateResult} initializes a global variable
%\CodeIn{localState} and other test methods use that variable. Therefore,
%7 tests using the \CodeIn{localState} variable exhibits
%a \CodeIn{NullPointerException} when they are executed before \CodeIn{testLocalStateResult}.
%\todo{KM}{I see no difference between the first item and this one. They all
%seem to happen due to one test initializing a global variable and the others
%reading the same global variable}
%
%\item 1 dependent test comes from class \CodeIn{ConflictDaemonTest}. This
%test uses a shared global variable which requires other tests in the
%same test class to initialize, \todo{KM}{Again, the same thing. I believe we
%should say that all dependencies are due to initialization of a global variable
%and then explain all of them as three sentences (instead of bullet pointing
%them as they were really different)}
%\end{itemize}
