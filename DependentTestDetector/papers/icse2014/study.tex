\section{Understanding Dependent Tests: Characteristic Study}
\label{sec:study}

Dependent tests reach beyond theory and appear in real-world programs.  
In some cases, they are intentional, developers are aware of them and
document them, but in other cases they are inadvertent. 
Test dependence can cause problems, not only when test suites are reordered,
but even when they are
executed in the intended order.
This section presents a study of concrete examples of test dependence found in
well-known open source programs. 

\subsection{Sources}


While this list---and associated set of examples---certainly is not exhaustive, it shows that there are
several classes of dependence-related problems that have practical
relevance.

\subsubsection{Categories}

Most dependent tests identified in our study fall into a small
number of categories\todo{how many, be specific}. We describe each category below and give
concrete examples in Section~\ref{sec:examples}.

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent \textbf{Masking Faults}
\emph{Masking} is a particularly perplexing problem caused by
dependence.
The negative effect of masking is that it hides a fault in the
program, \emph{exactly} when the test suite is executed in its default
order. 
Masking occurs when a test case $t$ (a) \emph{should}
reveal a fault, (b) only does so when executed in a specific environment
$\env_R$, but (c) tests executed before $t$ in a test suite always
generate environments different from
$\env_R$.
%To express this more
More precisely and without loss of generality, assume any
environment with only a single variable. Then let $T =
\suite{t_1,\dots,t_n}$ be the test suite, and let $t_i, 1 < i \leq n$
be the test that should reveal the fault in environment $\env_R$. A
dependency $t_k \prec t_i, k < i$ masks the fault if
$\exec{\suite{t_1,\dots,t_{i-1}}}{\env_0} \neq \env_R$.

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent \textbf{Spurious Bug Reports and Bug Fixes}
Sometimes developers introduce dependent tests intentionally because it is
easier, more efficient or more convenient to write unit tests for some modules
in that way~\cite{kapfhammeretal:FSE:2003, whittakeretal:2012}.
%DB-testing}.
Even though the developers are aware of these instances
when they create them, this knowledge can get lost, 
and other people who are not aware of these dependences can get confused 
when they run a subset of the test suite that manifests the
dependences.

As a result, they
might report bugs backed by the failing tests, although this is exactly the expected
behavior. If the dependence is not documented clearly and
correctly, it can take a considerable amount of time to work out that
these reported failures are spurious. Or worse, the developers may try
to fix a bug that is not there.


\vspace{1mm}

\noindent \textbf{Poor Test Construction.}
The test dependences in this category arise due to incorrect initialization
of program state by one or more tests. In the first case,
tested program code relies on a
global variable that is a part of the environment, but the test does
not properly initialize it.  In the second case, a test should but
does not call
an initialization function before later invocations to a complex library.
This flaw in the test code is masked because the default test suite execution
order includes other tests that initialize the library.  The defect is
inconsequential until and unless the flawed test is reordered, either manually or by
a downstream tool, to execute before any other initializing test.


\subsubsection{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

%The discussion of the examples in this section is distinguished by
%the problems caused by test dependence (\emph{Kind}): when faults are masked because
%tests make incorrect assumptions about the global environment (Section~\ref{sec:mask}); 
%when tests do not
%respect required initialization protocols (Section~\ref{sec:examples:initialization}); and when
%undocumented test dependence leads to spurious bug reports (Section~\ref{sec:spurious}).
%We also describe dependent tests in an automatically-generated test
%suite (Section~\ref{sec:autogen}).

We next give examples for each of the above categories.

}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Fault-related code from \code{Option\-Build\-er.java}}
\label{fig:option_builder}
\end{figure}

A straightforward example of fault masking occurs in the Apache CLI
library~\cite{cli}.
Two test cases fail when run in isolation:
\code{test13666} and \code{test\-Op\-tion\-With\-out\-Short\-For\-mat2} in test
classes \code{Bugs\-Test} and \code{Help\-For\-mat\-ter\-Test},
respectively.

A detailed study of the code under test revealed that both 
tests fail due to the same hidden dependence. The fault is located in 
\code{OptionBuilder.java} and is caused by not initializing a global
variable early enough.
Figure~\ref{fig:option_builder} shows code that
illustrates the fault. 
%
By default,
\code{argName} is initialized to \code{null} (line 2), and only set to
its intended default value \code{"arg"} by the \code{create()} method
via calling \code{reset()} (line 15). 
Consequently, if clients of CLI do not explicitly initialize the value of
\code{argName}, the first option created will have \code{null} rather
than \code{"arg"} as its argument name.
%In CLI, there are two types of options: options with and without
%argument names. If an option without argument is created first,
%this fault will not lead to a failure, because the \code{null} value
%will be ignored. Consecutive calls to \code{create()} can rely on
%\code{reset()} to establish the desired default value.

Both dependent tests
% \code{test13666} and \code{test27635} (or \code
% {test\-Op\-tion\-With\-out\-Short\-For\-mat2}) 
can reveal this fault, since they create an option with 
the default argument as the first thing in their execution. However,
in the default order of test execution, 
%the test classes \code{BugTest} and \code{Help\-For\-mat\-ter\-Test} both
%contain other 
tests that create options with explicit arguments execute \emph{before} 
these dependent tests.
% \code{test13666}
% and \code{test27635} respectively. 
%Thus, when the tests in these classes are 
%executed in order, the tests executed before \code{test13666}
%and \code{test27635} call \code{create()} 
Thus, the tests that are executed before call \code{create()} at least once, which
sets the default \code{argName} value, thus masking the fault.


This fault is reported in the bug
database several times,\footnote{\url{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLI-26} \url{https://
issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLI-186} \url{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/
CLI-187}} starting on March 13, 2004 (CLI-26). The report is marked as resolved
\emph{three years} later on March 15, 2007, but is then reopened as CLI-186 on
July 31, 2009. On this report, one of the developers commented:
\begin{quote}
I reproduced the issue, it requires a dedicated test case since it is tied to the initialization 
of a static field in OptionBuilder.
\end{quote}
Despite the realization that a dedicated test is required, no such
test was ever created.
About one month later, the bug is duplicated as CLI-187, and the
actual fix happens one 
year later on June 19, 2010, about six years after the bug was first reported (and four years
total on the open-issue list).
